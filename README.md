DCProductionPlant-Digital-Twin

DCProductionPlant-Digital-Twin is a Unity-based prototype that visualizes a digital twin of a direct current (DC) production plant, serving as an interactive, extensible foundation for simulation, visualization, and future integration with real-world production data.

This project provides a structured Unity environment to model key assets, flows, user interfaces, and logic for a production line. It is ideal for developers and engineers building digital twin applications for manufacturing visualization, monitoring, and extended reality (XR) experiences.

🚀 Features

Unity project with standard folder layout: Assets, Packages, ProjectSettings, and custom UI resources.

Placeholder scene(s) ready for extension with production plant elements.

Basis for integrating real-time data streams (e.g., OPC UA, MQTT, REST) into 3D plant models.

Designed for expansion toward desktop, VR/AR, or XR digital twin interfaces.

🛠️ Getting Started
Prerequisites

Unity Editor — Recommended latest Long-Term Support (LTS) version.

.NET / C# tooling — Installed automatically with Unity or via Visual Studio / VS Code.

Git — For version control and collaboration.

Setup

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Abhilash1205/DCProductionPlant-Digital-Twin.git


Open the project in Unity Hub.

Allow Unity to import assets and dependencies.

Load the main scene (e.g., Main.unity or equivalent).

Press Play in the Unity Editor to run the prototype.

📌 Usage Ideas

Visualize production line layout (machines, conveyors, buffers).

Simulate material flow and machine states.

Connect to live shop-floor systems for real-time insight.

Develop immersive VR/AR/XR dashboards for plant monitoring.

🔮 Roadmap

Planned improvements may include:

Core plant models — Add detailed equipment and layout.

Data interface layer — OPC UA/MQTT bridge for sensor and machine data.

Operator UI panels — Enriched dashboards via UIAssets.

XR support — VR/AR integration using Unity XR tools.

Documentation — Scene hierarchy and best practices.
